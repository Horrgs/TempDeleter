TempDeleter
===========

Delete all the files in the %temp% directory.

If you're unfamiliar with the %temp% directory, it's
a folder with a bunch of data, it's really not needed, 
and it get's filled up again after time, you should delete
it every month or so, as you get more space on your computer.
The files being deleted aren't needed, as the file directory
is called Temp, short for Temporary, you can read up on it here

All you need is to have Java 7 or later in order to run this program,
this may work with 6 but I don't know, I will add support if I'm notified
it doesn't work for 6. 


You run the program as Java Program and hit delete, and there you go, all
those unneeded files gone! If you'd like to see if I'm lying or not, don't
run it, do Windows Key + R then type in "%temp%" and then run the program.
All the files that are still remaining can't be deleted at the moment as
most likely they're for a program that is running at the moment, enjoy!
